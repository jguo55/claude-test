This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Python project with a single `main.py` file. The repository appears to be set up for testing or initial development purposes.

## Development Commands

Since this is a basic Python project without specific build tools or dependencies configured:

- **Run the main script**: `python main.py`
- **Check Python syntax**: `python -m py_compile main.py`
- **Format code**: `python -m black main.py` (if black is installed)
- **Lint code**: `python -m flake8 main.py` (if flake8 is installed)

## Architecture

Currently, the project consists of a single empty Python file (`main.py`) with no defined architecture or dependencies.
